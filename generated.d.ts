         *     The **Participant waiting for host to join** event is triggered every time an attendee is waiting for the host to join the meeting. The host of the meeting must be a user in your account or users in any other accounts that have installed your [webhook-enabled](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/webhook-reference#enable-webhooks) app.
         *
         *     When scheduling a meeting, the organizer or host of the meeting can enable the **Enable join before host** option. This allows attendees to join the meeting before the host of the meeting arrives. This meeting also starts as soon as the first meeting participant joins.
         *
         *     If this option is **disabled**, participants are prompted to wait for the host to arrive before joining the meeting.

         *     The **Recording transcript files have completed** event is triggered every time the transcript of the recording is made available for one of your app users or account users after the recorded meeting/webinar ends.

To utilize audio transcription, users must first [enable](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004794983-Automatically-Transcribe-Cloud-Recordings) it. An account owner or a user with admin permissions can enable cloud recording for an account or a group of users.

         *
         *     * A Business, Education, or Enterprise license.
         *     * Cloud recording must be enabled on the users' account.
         *     * **Event Subscriptions** must be enabled for your [Marketplace app](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build) with the following configurations:

         *     The **View registrant has approved for this recording** event is triggered every time a registrant is approved to view a cloud recording.
         *
         *     [Cloud recordings](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203741855-Cloud-Recording) of Zoom meetings and webinars can be made [on-demand](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000488283-On-demand-Recordings). With on-demand recordings, users can view the recordings of past meetings and webinars at any time as long as they have not been removed. To view these recordings, users can register manually by filling out the registration form that pops up when users click on the **Recording URL**. After the registration, registrants that are approved will be able to view the recording.
         *
         *     An account owner, a host of the meeting/webinar or a user with admin privileges can customize the cloud recording [registration approval settings](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000488283-On-demand-Recordings). If the **Automatically Approve** setting is enabled, registrants can view the recording automatically after a successful registration. If the **Manually Approve** setting is enabled, the registrants must be manually approved before they can view the recording.
         *
         *     Registrants can also be approved programmatically using the [**Update registrant status**](/api-reference/zoom-api/ma#operation/meetingRecordingRegistrantStatus) API.

         *     The **Participant joined a waiting room** event is triggered every time an attendee joins a waiting room prior to being admitted to the meeting. The meeting host must be a user in your account or a user in any other accounts that have installed your [webhook-enabled](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/webhook-reference/#enable-webhooks) app.
         *
         *     The [**waiting room**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room) feature allows the host to control when participants join a meeting. When a participant attempts to join a meeting with this feature enabled, the participant is first admitted to the waiting room.
         *     The meeting host can then admit attendees one by one or hold all attendees in the waiting room and admit them all at once.

This customization allows them to choose whether to approve attendees automatically or manually.
         *
         *     When the registration is set to be approved manually, a pending registrant can either be approved or denied from joining the Webinar.

         *     To approve a registrant manually, navigate to the [Webinars](https://zoom.us/webinar/list) page and click on the name of the webinar. Click **Edit** to the right of **Manage Attendees** option, select the registrant and click **Approve**. Alternatively, use the [**Update registrant's status**](/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/methods#operation/webinarRegistrantStatus) API to approve the registrant programmatically.

The meeting host should be a user on your account or a user of your [webhook-enabled](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/webhook-reference#enable-webhooks) app.
         *
         *     A meeting host or a user with admin privileges can restrict meeting registrations by manually approving registrants. With the **Manually Approve** option enabled for [meeting registrations](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/211579443-Registration-for-Meetings), the host of the meeting must approve registrants before they receive information about how to join the meeting.
         *
         *     Meeting hosts can approve an attendee's meeting invitation via the [Zoom web portal](https://zoom.us). To do this, navigate to the scheduled meeting's page and click **Edit** next to the **Manage Attendees** section. Select the attendee to approve in the **Pending Approval** section, then click **Approve**.
         *
         *     To programmatically approve an attendee's registration, use the [**Update registrant's status**](/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/methods#operation/meetingRegistrantStatus) API.

         *
         *     The **Participant left a waiting room** event is triggered every time a meeting host **does not** admit a participant to the meeting and **removes** the participant from the waiting room. This event also triggers if a participant leaves the waiting room. The meeting host must be a user in your account or a user in any other accounts that have installed your [webhook-enabled](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/webhook-reference#enable-webhooks) app.
         *
         *     The [**waiting room**](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room) feature allows the host to control when participants join a meeting. When a participant attempts to join a meeting with this feature enabled, the participant is first admitted to the waiting room.
         *     The meeting host can then admit attendees one by one or hold all attendees in the waiting room and admit them all at once.
         *
         *     ## Prerequisites

         *     The **Batch recording recovered** event is triggered every time one of your app users or account users recover one or more recordings from the trash.

You can recover a deleted cloud recording via the [**Recordings** tab in the Zoom web client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/216378863-Recover-a-Deleted-Cloud-Recording) or via the [**Recover meeting recordings**](/api-reference/zoom-api/ma#operation/recordingStatusUpdate) API.
